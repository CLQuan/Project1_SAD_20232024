## Introduction

Restaurant Management System (RMS) are becoming indispensable tools in current’s restaurant business for improving client experiences and optimizing operations. However plenty of restaurants, for instance Siao Sheng Ya, is having problems with their existing RMS. At present, the Siao Sheng Ya restaurant’s manager, Mr. Chew state that the restaurant only accepts orders from diners and takeout customers using a primitive RMS. However, this system lacks of crucial features such as advanced reservation capabilities, online payment options and delivery administration. In addition to this, processing payments and entering orders by hand at the counter causes inefficiencies and service delays. Due to its restricted capabilities, the restaurant unable to effectively compete in the market and adapt to changing client needs. 

Mr. Chew intends to improve the current RMS to better serve the demands of the restaurant’s patrons in order to address these issues. In order to maintain its competitive edge in the fast-paced restaurants sector of nowadays, Mr. Chen is modernizing its system to incorporate enhanced reservation capabilities, delivery management and online payment choices.


## Background Study
<p align="justify">
Currently, Siao Sheng Ya restaurant relies on a basic restaurant management system (RMS) to handle its daily operations, encompassing food ordering, menu display, and pick-up services for dining in or takeout orders. Despite its reputation for delectable cuisine, the restaurant grapples with inefficiencies in delivery management, reservation capabilities, and payment methods. Mr. Chew, the proprietor, has turned to DineDart.com, a robust platform, to optimize his operations and enhance customer service.
<p align="justify">
Additionally, Mr. Chew has observed a significant number of students and low-income families patronizing his establishment. Recognizing the need to cater to their needs, he contemplates offering a dedicated menu tailored to their preferences, aiming to provide a welcoming atmosphere for all patrons. In the fiercely competitive restaurant industry, customer satisfaction is paramount. However, Siao Sheng Ya faces challenges in delivering seamless dining experiences and promptly addressing customer inquiries.
<p align="justify">
The current pick-up service falls short of meeting service standards and fostering customer loyalty. Moreover, the limited payment options, particularly the requirement to pay at the counter, result in long queues and inconvenience for customers. The absence of a reservation system further compounds the issue, forcing patrons to wait in line, leading to frustration and potential loss of business.
<p align="justify">
To address these challenges, Siao Sheng Ya seeks to digitize key operational processes, including delivery management, payment processing, catering menus, and reservation capabilities. By leveraging the capabilities of DineDart.com, the restaurant aims to streamline operations, enhance service efficiency, and elevate the overall dining experience for its customers. Through innovative technology and seamless integration, Siao Sheng Ya endeavors to delight customers and achieve excellence in its business operations.


## Problem Statement

| Problem | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| 1. Limited Website Access | <br> Many restaurants have websites primarily designed to showcase their menu, ambiance, and location. However, access to these websites is often restricted to patrons physically present in the restaurant. This limitation arises from a traditional mind-set that views the website as an extension of the physical establishment rather than a tool for reaching potential customers beyond the premises. Consequently, individuals seeking information about the restaurant’s offerings, making reservations, or placing delivery orders are unable to do so without visiting the restaurant in person. This restricts the restaurant’s ability to attract new customers and limits the convenience for existing ones, particularly those who prefer to plan their dining experiences in advance or order food for delivery. <br> |
| 2. Lack of Reservation System | <br>In the absence of a reservation system, customers may encounter difficulties securing a table, especially during peak dining hours or for special occasions such as holidays or anniversaries. This can lead to frustration, longer wait times, or even loss of business if potential diners opt for alternative establishments with reservation capabilities. Moreover, without a centralized system for managing reservations, restaurant staff may struggle to keep track of bookings, leading to overbooking or underutilization of available seating capacity. As a result, both customers and restaurant management are inconvenienced, impacting overall satisfaction and operational efficiency. <br> |
| 3. Absence of Delivery System ▏<br>With the rise of food delivery platforms and changing consumer preferences, offering delivery services has become increasingly important for restaurants to remain competitive and meet the evolving needs of their customers. However, many restaurants still lack an integrated delivery system, relying instead on third-party delivery services that may impose high commission fees and compromise the restaurant's Brand experience. By not having control over the delivery process, restaurants risk inconsistency in food quality, longer delivery times, and potential disputes with delivery partners. Additionally, without a direct delivery option, restaurants miss out on potential revenue streams from customers who prefer the convenience of having food delivered to their doorstep. <br> |
| 4. Limited Payment Methods ▏<br>The payment landscape has evolved significantly with the advent of digital payment technologies, yet some restaurants continue to offer limited payment options such as cash-only or a select few credit/debit cards. This poses challenges for customers who prefer alternative payment methods such as mobile wallets, online payment platforms, or contactless transactions. By not accommodating diverse payment preferences, restaurants risk alienating a segment of their customer base and may lose out on potential sales opportunities. Moreover, in an increasingly cashless society, relying solely on cash payments may hinder operational efficiency and increase the risk of errors or theft. <br> |
| 5. Difficulty in Switching Menu Interface | <br>Mr Kiho found that switching menu interfaces presents a formidable challenge. Each time he attempts to make a transition, he encounters a barrage of error codes that disrupt the process, necessitating the involvement of technicians to rectify the issues. This not only incurs significant expenses but also results in considerable time delays, hindering our ability to adapt our menu promptly to meet customer demands or market trends. The impact of this problem goes beyond financial and operational concerns; it also affects the overall customer experience. Inaccurate or outdated menu information can lead to dissatisfaction among patrons, eroding trust and potentially driving them to seek dining alternatives. This ongoing difficulty in switching menu interfaces poses a substantial obstacle to our business's efficiency and competitiveness in the market.<br> |

## Objective
We set a handful objectives to improvise and simplify our client’s difficulties which are introduced above:
<p align="justify">
&emsp;1.     To provide the customers with a better way to reserve a seat in the restaurant.<br>
&emsp;2.     To organize the way of ordering the menu in the restaurant.<br>
&emsp;3.     To give an option for a customer to have their food delivered to their home.<br>
&emsp;4.     To reduce the owner's worker time for taking orders for each table.<br>
&emsp;5.     To encourage clients for a cashless payment.</p>

## Scope of Study
### Project Scope
<p align="justify">
We are committed to improving the system that helps a restaurant owner for a better way of handling the premises. Aside from that, the customers also can navigate the reservation section and select the date, time, number of guests, and seating preferences. The system provides a few features to enhance the user experience for a good reason. As an example, the owner will not need to go to each table for a customer's order apart from that, the customer also doesn’t need to queue up for in-store payment. In addition, there is also a delivery option for the customers sent to their destination. Finally, there are two types of clients which are owners and customers, and each of the different types of clients will have different ways of using this system.

* **For owner**:
<p align="justify">
In this system, the owner is an administrator of the system have a privilege to modify the inventory data conveniently. They can list all the dishes in the menu for advertising and receiving the order from the customers. Furthermore, the orders for pick up, reservations or delivering will be separated to each of the workers who conduct their departments systematically. Last but not least, the owner can set up the time period for shipping of the order from the customers based on the order received.

* __For customers__:
<p align="justify">
The system will need the customers to fill in their phone number and name for keep in touch with the order or reservation details. Then, the system will show all the menu in the premise with a different section for beverage and food. Besides, the customers can sort out the menu by the price range for the search of “Menu Rahmah” easily.  There are options of paying provided based on how the order will be. For instance, customers who pick up the order will need to pay via online banking or in-store payment, but in-store eating will provide a QR code for payment method with a security verification which allows the customers to upload a screenshot of the payment to the system.
